# SimpleBMICalculator-Kotlin
 It is a Simple BMI Calculator Application made with Kotlin.
 
<b>The application is written in Kotlin programming language via AndroidStudio IDE.
While developing this application,<i> ViewBinding </i>was used and added to the <i>build.gradle</i> file. In addition, after the last innovation, a sample diet program has been added according to the user's BMI</b>.

BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a numerical value that is used to determine a person's level of body fat. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

The formula for calculating BMI is as follows:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) x height (m))

For example, if a person weighs 68 kilograms and is 1.7 meters tall, their BMI would be calculated as follows:

BMI = 68 / (1.7 x 1.7) = 23.5

BMI values are interpreted as follows:

BMI below 18.5 - Underweight
BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 - Normal weight
BMI between 25 and 29.9 - Overweight
BMI of 30 or higher - Obese
It's important to note that BMI is just one of many factors that can contribute to a person's overall health. It's also important to consider other factors such as muscle mass, body composition, and overall fitness level. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of one's health status.

The application is written in Kotlin programming language via AndroidStudio IDE.
While developing this application, ViewBinding was used and added to the build.gradle file. In addition, after the last innovation, a sample diet program has been added according to the user's bmi.
